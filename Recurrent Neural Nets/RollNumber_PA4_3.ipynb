The goal of summarization is to make it easier for readers to understand and remember the main points of a text. There are two main approaches to summarization: extractive and abstractive.\n","\n","Extractive summarization involves *selecting* the most important sentences or phrases from the original text and concatenating them to form a summary. Extractive summarization may result in summaries that are disjointed or fail to capture the overall meaning of the original text.\n","\n","Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, involves *generating* a summary that may contain new phrases or sentences not present in the original text. This approach requires a deeper understanding of the text and the ability to generate coherent and grammatically correct sentences. Abstractive summarization has the potential to generate more informative and readable summaries, but it is also more challenging and less mature than extractive summarization.\n","\n","In recent years, deep learning models have shown significant progress in abstractive summarization. T5, a transformer-based language model developed by Google, has shown promising results in various natural language processing tasks, including abstractive summarization. In this part, we will explore the use of T5 for abstractive summarization and evaluate its performance on a dataset of *dialogues* (the SAMSum dataset).\n","\n","We will be using HuggingFace in this part. It is a framework, rather similar to PyTorch, but specialized for using and training Transformer models. It has a very rich ecosystem, provides a huge variety of models, and you will likely find something to suit your use case very easily here (note that these are BIG models, so try not to run them on an ancient computer).\n","\n","As you may see in the cell below, we have imported things like `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` and `AutoTokenizer` from HuggingFace. These classes provide an easy interface for us to instantiate models, along with the Tokenizers that work the best **with those** models. Since this is a **framework** and not a simple library, one has to play by its rules: it expects things to be done in a very specific way.\n","\n","**Important:** This part expects you to be very comfortable with reading documentation. This means being able to google how each of the classes work, what kinds of methods are available, how to go about doing specific things like setting up a Trainer etc. The documentation is very good, and there are many forum posts for all sorts of issues.\n","\n","To familiarize yourself with the tool, start with the documentation [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and with this introductory video [here](https://youtu.be/QEaBAZQCtwE). If you're stuck, google it."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-19T17:38:38.332732Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-19T17:38:38.332303Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-19T17:38:49.597473Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-19T17:38:49.596230Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-19T17:38:38.332695Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Installs\n","!pip install -q evaluate py7zr rouge_score absl-py\n","\n","# Imports here\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import nltk\n","from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize\n","nltk.download(\"punkt\")\n","\n","import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","\n","import datasets\n","import transformers\n","from transformers import (\n","        AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM,\n","        Seq2SeqTrainingArguments,\n","        Seq2SeqTrainer,\n","        AutoTokenizer\n",")\n","import evaluate\n","\n","# Quality of life fixes\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","from pprint import pprint\n","\n","import os\n","os.environ[\"WANDB_DISABLED\"] = \"true\"\n","\n","from IPython.display import clear_output\n","\n","print(f\"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}\")\n","print(f\"Transformers version: {transformers.__version__}\")\n","print(f\"Datasets version: {datasets.__version__}\")\n","print(f\"Evaluate version: {evaluate.__version__}\")\n","\n","# Get the samsum dataset\n","samsum = datasets.load_dataset('samsum')\n","clear_output()\n","print(\"Setup done!\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-19T17:38:49.601133Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-19T17:38:49.600268Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-19T17:38:49.609353Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-19T17:38:49.608213Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-03-19T17:38:49.601084Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# What does this dataset object look like?\n","samsum"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Now that we've downloaded the dataset from HuggingFace and examined it, we see that it has already been conveniently split for us.
